# Ezno's Parser

Contains "string to AST" parser, AST definitions, AST back to text/string form methods and hooks for traversing/visiting AST. Used in the Ezno checker.

This is more of an exercise project in getting better at writing Rust and doesn't offer too much over other great Rust based JS parsers such as [swc](https://github.com/swc-project/swc), [rome](https://github.com/rome/tools), [oxc](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/oxc) and [boa](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa).

## Goals

- Keep under 15k lines of code (excluding `/tests` and `/examples` folders)
- Easy to use API (see `/tests` and `/examples` folders for example usage)
- Run in WASM
- Keep readable and maintainable
- **Designed for analysis and transformations**
   	- See expression identifiers can be used to bind information to
   	- Retain source positions for throwing errors
   	- All AST should be visitable. Immutably to collect facts or mutable to transform/remove
- Optionally via configuration extend the ECMAscript language definition
   	- TypeScript type annotations
      		- Interfaces, enums and type alias statements
      		- Parameter, return type and variable annotations
      		- `satisfies` and `as` ðŸ˜‘
   	- JSX support
      		- Includes HTML comments, special handing of self closing tags from the specification
   	- Others under `feature = "extras"` ðŸ‘€

## Non-goals

- CSTs, close to source operations etc
   	- Source with unbalanced parenthesis/brackets
- Increase code size or decrease readability for minor speed improvements
- Allow injecting additional syntax, that would require modifying the lexer at runtime adding new tokens which isn't technically possible with the setup

### Testing

> If in main root rather than this folder, add `-p ezno-parser` after `cargo run` to the following commands.

For testing whether the parser can lex a file

```shell
cargo run --example lex path/to/file.js
```

and parse

```shell
cargo run --example parse path/to/file.js
```

> Note the Ezno CLI includes `ast-playground`: a more user focused version of these commands

## Features

### Positions

All syntax has reference to where it was in the source using a [Span](https://docs.rs/ezno-parser/0.0.2/ezno_parser/struct.Span.html). This uses the [source-map](https://github.com/kaleidawave/source-map) crate, so it can generate source maps.

### "Cursors"

Allows holes in AST where a cursor exists. This allows for LSP to provide suggestions here while the whole source might not be valid.

### Visiting

[See example](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/blob/main/parser/tests/visiting.rs)

### Generator

Easily generate AST nodes with data interpolation using the constant compiled quasi-quoted macro. [See example](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/blob/main/parser/generator/examples/example.rs).
