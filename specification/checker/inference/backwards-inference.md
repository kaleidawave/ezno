We have `unknown`, when we use it we append requirements. At the end of the scope, the constraint of the parameter is modified to meet those requirements

- Subtyping constraints
- Property reads
- Function calls. Function returns
- Nesting
- Free variables
- Through conditionals
- Problems with events
