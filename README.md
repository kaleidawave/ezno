A JavaScript compiler and TypeScript checker written in Rust with a focus on static analysis and runtime performance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ezno is in active development and **does not currently support enough features to check existing projects** (see [blocking issues](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/labels/blocking)). Check out the [getting started guide](./checker/documentation/getting-started.md) for experimenting with what it [currently supports](./checker/specification/specification.md).

What Ezno is:
- A type checker for JavaScript usable through a CLI ([with a LSP also in the works](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/issues/22))
- Checks programs with guaranteed type safety (no runtime [`TypeError`s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError)) (**as long as definitions are sound**)
- Types aimed at soundness and tracing for better static analysis
- A *imperative* type system that tracks and evaluates the side effects of functions and control flow structures. It is similar to an interpreter, but acts with types instead of *values* and does not run IO, side effects, etc.
- A collection of experiments of types. Many are being worked out and are in the prototype stage. Some of the new behaviors benefit JavaScript specifically and others could be applied to other languages
- Written in Rust
- [Fast](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/actions/workflows/performance-and-size.yml) and [Small](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/actions/workflows/lines-of-code.yml)
- Open source! [You can help build Ezno!](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue%2Cfeedback-needed)
- A challenge to the status quo of type checking, optimisations and compilation through deeper static analysis beyond syntax analysis!

What Ezno is not
- **eNZo, the Z is in front of the N** (pronounce as 'Fresno' without the 'fr') ðŸ˜€
- Be on parity with TSC or 1:1, it has some different behaviors **but** should work in existing projects using TSC
- Faster as a means to serve large codebases. Cut out bloat and complex code first!
- Smarter as a means to allow more *dynamic patterns*. Keep things simple!
- A binary executable compiler. It takes in JavaScript (or a TypeScript or Ezno superset) and does similar processes to traditional compilers, but at the end emits JavaScript. However, in the future, it *could* generate a lower level format using its event (side-effect) representation.
