A JavaScript compiler and TypeScript checker written in Rust with a focus on static analysis and runtime performance.

![](https://projects.kaleidawave.workers.dev/project/ezno/badge)

What Ezno is
- A type checker for JavaScript with *optional* compiler infrastructure (parser, CLI, LSP etc)
- Written in Rust
- Fully typed programs, guaranteeing type safety (as long as definitions are sound)
- Types aimed at soundness and tracing for better static analysis
- A *imperative* type system, with event tracing and evaluating function side effects
- A partial / type based interpreter
- A collection of experiments of types

What Ezno is not
- **eNZo, Z goes before the N** (pronounce as 'Fresno' without the 'fr') ðŸ˜€
- 1:1 / parity with TSC, it has different behaviors **but** should work in existing projects using TSC (check out [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc) that is aimed at 1:1)

This project is a workspace consisting of a few crates:

| Crate | Lines Of Code <div style="min-width: 150px"><div> | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| parser | ![](https://projects.kaleidawave.workers.dev/project/ezno-parser/badge) | Contains AST definitions, logic for parsing and serializing, and visiting |
<!-- | checker | ![](https://projects.kaleidawave.workers.dev/project/ezno-parser/badge) | Contains logic for validating types in AST, generating in memory type representation, a 7 phase visiting step for extensions and low level interpolation and graphing of code | 
| ezno-web-framework | ![](https://projects.kaleidawave.workers.dev/project/framework/badge) | Visitors and code generation for JSX and reactive expression transformations. | -->

## Experimental

This is an experimental compiler. If you are looking for a stable compiler, Ezno is not the right choice **at the moment**.
